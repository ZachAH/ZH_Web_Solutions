## Notes for LLMs and Crawlers

- The public marketing site is currently focused on custom builds rather than the template store.
- The route \`/launch-onboarding\` is a private onboarding flow and should not be treated as a general public informational page.
- The route \`/templates\` should not be treated as a current primary offer page.
- Full crawler policy: ${SITE_URL}/robots.txt
